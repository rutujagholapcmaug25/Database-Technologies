# ACID Properties in DBMS

A **database transaction** is a logical unit of work in a database that typically consists of multiple operations such as creating, updating, or retrieving data. Transactions must ensure **data integrity** and consistency, even in the case of errors, system crashes, or concurrent access.  

The reliability of transactions is enforced by the **ACID properties**: **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability**.

---

## 1. Atomicity
**Definition:**  
Atomicity ensures that a transaction is **all-or-nothing**: either all operations within the transaction are executed successfully, or none are executed. No partial execution is allowed.  

**Example:**
```
User1 balance = 1000
User2 balance = 2000

Transaction: Transfer 400 from User1 to User2
- Debit 400 from User1
- Credit 400 to User2

After Transaction:
User1 = 600
User2 = 2400
```
If any step fails (e.g., credit to User2 fails), the **whole transaction is rolled back**.  

**Use Cases:**  
- Banking transfers  
- Payment processing  

**Implementation:**  
- DBMS ensures atomicity using **transaction logs** and rollback mechanisms.
- Commands: `START TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`.

---

## 2. Consistency
**Definition:**  
Consistency ensures that a transaction transforms the database from one **valid state** to another, **maintaining all integrity constraints**.  

**Example:**
```
User1 balance = 600
User2 balance = 2500

Transaction: Debit 100 from User1
Resulting balances:
- User1 = 500
- User2 unchanged
```
The database remains consistent before and after the transaction.  

**Use Cases:**  
- Maintaining data integrity in banking systems  
- Validating business rules in e-commerce systems  

**Implementation:**  
- Defined using **constraints**, **triggers**, and **rules** in the database.  
- DBMS automatically enforces constraints like `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `CHECK`.

---

## 3. Isolation
**Definition:**  
Isolation ensures that **concurrent transactions** do not interfere with each other. Changes made by a transaction are not visible to other transactions until the transaction is committed.  

**Example:**
- Two users book airline seats simultaneously:
  - Isolation prevents both users from booking the same seat.
  - Transactions execute as if they are **sequential**.

**Use Cases:**  
- Reservation systems (airline, hotels)  
- Simultaneous banking operations  

**Implementation:**  
- Achieved via **locking mechanisms** or **MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)**.
- Isolation levels in SQL: `READ UNCOMMITTED`, `READ COMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE READ`, `SERIALIZABLE`.

---

## 4. Durability
**Definition:**  
Durability guarantees that once a transaction is **committed**, its changes are **permanent**, even in the event of a system crash.  

**Example:**  
```
ATM withdrawal: 1000 INR
- Money dispensed to user
- Transaction committed in database
Even if power fails, transaction is saved permanently
```

**Use Cases:**  
- Banking transaction records  
- E-commerce order confirmations  

**Implementation:**  
- Uses **transaction logs** and **commit mechanisms**.
- Command: `COMMIT`.

## Advantages of ACID
1. **Data Integrity:** Ensures database remains correct and consistent.  
2. **Reliability:** Predictable transaction execution.  
3. **Concurrency Control:** Supports multiple users without conflicts.  
4. **Fault Tolerance:** Prevents data loss in system failures.  
5. **Transaction Management:** Structured handling of operations.

---

## Disadvantages of ACID
1. **Performance Overhead:** Extra processing for compliance.  
2. **Complexity:** Harder database design and maintenance.  
3. **Scalability Challenges:** Limited in distributed systems.  
4. **Deadlocks:** Locking mechanisms can cause transaction waits.  
5. **Limited Concurrency:** Some access restrictions reduce throughput.

---

## Use Cases of ACID
- **Banking Systems:** Secure money transfers  
- **Reservation Systems:** Avoid double-booking  
- **E-commerce Systems:** Reliable order processing  

---

## ACID Implementation in MySQL
- Use **transaction-safe storage engines** like **InnoDB**.  
- Commands:
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
-- SQL operations here
COMMIT;    -- Saves all changes permanently
ROLLBACK;  -- Reverts changes if error occurs
```
- Ensure proper constraints: `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `NOT NULL`, `CHECK`.

---

## Storage Engines Supporting ACID
- **InnoDB:** Fully supports transactions, foreign keys, and ACID.  
- **MyISAM:** Not transaction-safe; ACID not supported.  

**MySQL Query to check engines:**
```sql
SHOW ENGINES;
SHOW TABLE STATUS;
```
